    "summary": "A visual node-based IDE for designing, training, and tuning GENREG (Genetic Regulatory) AI models",
    "description": "Genome Studio provides a LiteGraph-based interface to construct and visualize AI architectures that combine evolutionary algorithms with regulatory protein networks. The system uses Snake as a testbed environment, but the architecture is designed to be environment-agnostic for future applications.",
    "goals": [
      "Visualize AI model architecture as connected node graphs",
      "Real-time monitoring of training metrics (trust, fitness, population stats)",
      "Interactive parameter tuning without code changes",
      "Separation of regulatory layer (proteins) from functional layer (controller)",
