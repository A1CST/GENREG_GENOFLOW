🧬 GenoFlow: The Visual IDE for Genetic Regulatory AIGenoFlow (formerly Genome Studio) is a visual, node-based development environment for designing, training, and tuning GENREG (Genetic Regulatory) AI models. Inspired by biological gene regulatory networks, GenoFlow allows users to visually construct complex, self-adapting AI architectures that combine a functional neural network layer with a stateful, trust-modulating protein network.✨ Key Features🎨 Visual, Node-Based Architecture: Build and visualize your entire AI model using an intuitive, ComfyUI-like graph editor powered by LiteGraph.js.🔬 Biologically Inspired Layers (GENREG):Protein Network (Regulatory Layer): Stateless, self-adapting "proteins" (e.g., Sensor, Trend, Comparator, TrustModifier) process environmental signals to generate a Trust Delta (fitness signal).Controller Network (Functional Layer): A simple feed-forward neural network that selects actions based on the processed signals.🌱 Trust-Based Evolution: The system uses an evolutionary algorithm where Genome fitness is determined by its accumulated Trust score, promoting robust and adaptive behaviors.🐍 Real-Time Environment: Train and observe your AI's behavior in a simulated Snake Environment, with real-time visualization via a separate Pygame window.🖥️ Client-Server Architecture: A Python FastAPI/WebSocket backend handles all heavy processing (evolution, environment steps) while the JavaScript frontend provides the interactive GUI.🚀 Quick Start1. PrerequisitesGenoFlow requires Python and a few libraries, including fastapi and uvicorn for the server, and optionally pygame for the environment visualization.Bash# Recommended: Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
2. InstallationInstall the required Python packages:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
# To enable environment visualization:
pip install pygame
Note: The requirements.txt includes core dependencies1: fastapi, uvicorn, and websockets.3. Running the ServerStart the backend server using uvicorn as defined in start_server.py:Bashpython start_server.py
The server will typically start at http://0.0.0.0:8000.4. Accessing the IDEOpen your web browser and navigate to:http://localhost:8000
You can then load the provided snake_training_template.json to begin exploring the system's training flow.📐 Architecture OverviewThe GenoFlow system is divided into distinct layers, reflecting its biological inspiration and client-server design.ComponentTechnologyRoleCore FilesFrontend IDELiteGraph.js, Vanilla JSVisual graph editor, monitoring, real-time control.static/js/*.js, static/index.htmlBackend ServerPython (FastAPI, WebSocket)Handles all AI processing, evolution, and simulation.start_server.pyController LayerPython (Controller class)Functional layer (Feed-Forward NN) for action selection.genreg_controller.pyRegulatory LayerPython (Protein classes)Stateful units for generating a Trust Delta fitness signal.genreg_proteins.pyEvolution CorePython (Genome, Population)Manages the evolutionary process and selection.genreg_genome.py, genreg_population.pyThe GENREG Model FlowThe training process is orchestrated by the node graph, following a loop:Environment Step (SnakeEnvironment) outputs signals.Protein Network processes signals and calculates Trust Delta.Controller Network uses signals to select an Action.Action is fed back into the environment.After the episode, the Genome's total Trust determines its fitness.A Generation Manager triggers the Evolution of the population.🛠️ Node TypesThe IDE provides various nodes to construct and monitor the AI:CategoryExample NodesPurposeRegulatorySensor, Trend, Trust ModifierProcess signals and influence the Genome's Trust.FunctionalController NetworkInput signals and output the selected action.EnvironmentSnake Environment, Visualize (Pygame)Simulates the world and visualizes the agent's behavior.EvolutionPopulation Controller, Episode RunnerManage the entire training and mutation lifecycle.🤝 ContributionGenoFlow is an evolving project. We welcome contributions to add new protein types, environments, visualization tools, or extend the core evolutionary algorithms.
